# Genetic Algorithms

This repository includes implementations of Genetic Algorithms for the following projects:

* Find the maximum of a very complicated function. This is a purely GA problem, solved with the basic version of the algorithm.

* A more elaborate problem, consisting of finding an optimal chemotherapy treatment for cancer patients. It is inspired by example 5.3 in [this paper by John McCall](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377042705000774). The proposed statement of the problem can be found in [Lluís Alsedà's Optimization course webpage](http://mat.uab.cat/~alseda/MasterOpt/index.html).
